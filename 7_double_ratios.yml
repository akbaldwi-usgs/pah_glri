    # with mean ranks. Because not every source has each ratio available, this table also 
    # reports n_poss which is the number of times that source was compared to samples across
    # the three double ratio plots (this is a multiple of the number of samples). "perc_top" is the
    # number of times the source was top ranked for any sample-source comparison across the three
    # double ratio plots, divided by the number of comparisons. 
    # 'sample' shows top source by sample for each double ratio plot of interest
